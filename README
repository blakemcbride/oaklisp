This is the Oaklisp source distribution.

Oaklisp is a portable lisp interpreter / compiler for the Oaklisp
dialect of lisp.

Oaklisp is an object-oriented dialect of lisp sharing the standard
lisp syntax, including common lisp style macros, first class types,
multiple inheritance, and multiple namespaces (packages).  Oaklisp is
also a Lisp-1 dialect meaning functions and variables share the same
namespace (like Scheme).

The compiler compiles Oaklisp source code into byte-code for the
included Oaklisp emulator / virtual machine.  The system is best
described in the included documentation.

Oaklisp was written by Barak A. Pearlmutter and Kevin J. Lang.
The original distribution is located at https://github.com/barak/oaklisp
This clone of the distribution ( https://github.com/blakemcbride/oaklisp )
was created to accomplish the following:

1.  make the system easy to build

    a.  smooth out the makefiles

    b.  include required binary files (oakworld.bin)

    c.  include pre-built doc files

2.  make the system easy to understand

    a.  include easier build docs

    b.  create a tutorial

3.  future enhancements

Once you get a copy of the system, see BUILD.txt for instructions on
how to build the system.
