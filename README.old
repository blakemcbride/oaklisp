This is the Oaklisp source distribution.

Oaklisp's home is:
http://oaklisp.alioth.debian.org/

Old releases are still at:
See http://www-bcl.cs.may.ie/~barak/oaklisp/ for updates.


*** GETTING IT WORKING ***

 Oaklisp should be straightforward to install on a virgin machine.
 You need to compile some C source to make the emulator:

   make -C src/emulator install

 If you want the emulator to look for its world somewhere else, add eg
    CPPFLAGS='-DFAST -DDEFAULT_WORLD=\"/usr/local/lib/oaklisp/oakworld.bin\"'

 Then you need to put the recompiled binary world it will use in place:

   cp -a src/world/oakworld.bin /usr/local/lib/oaklisp/

 (You can't just use "make -C src/world install" because a new world
 can't be built until Oaklisp is working, which requires a world to be
 installed.  That's why the source distribution includes a pre-built
 oakworld.bin.)

 Now invoking /usr/local/bin/oaklisp should land you in an Oaklisp
 read-eval-print loop.


*** INSTALLING DOCUMENTATION ***

Probably you should

  make -C man install

The language and implementation manuals are in doc/lang/lang.ps and
doc/lim/lim.ps.  They are latex source but include working Makefiles.
You should be able to build and install them with

  make -C doc install


*** BUILDING A NEW WORLD ***

Note that Oaklisp is written in Oaklisp, so you must have a working
Oaklisp before you can rebuild the Oaklisp world, which is done via

 make -C src/world

In fact, you should be able to rebuild and reinstall *everything* via

  make install

in this top-level directory.
